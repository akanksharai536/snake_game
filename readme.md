# Snake Game
###### <I> *** This project is a learning project. Please refer it just for learning purpose. multiple resources from internet source has been a inspiration for this project. *** </I>

In Python, I am building a game called “Snake game” where the player handles a snake. The snake walks around the screen and eats food to grow. It tries to avoid hitting the edges or itself. We use a GUI tool like Pygame or Tkinter to handle the graphics and add features like user input, snake movement, contact recognition, eating food, the game loop, and game over. 

It’s a fun way to learn how to make games and how to code in Python.

#### Pre-Requisites
To make the Snake game in the Python computer language, you should know the basics of programming and the Python language. It would be helpful to know about the following things:

<br><b> Python fundamentals: </b> Knowledge of variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic file I/O in Python.
<br><b>Object-oriented programming (OOP):</b> Understanding OOP ideas like classes, objects, inheritance, and isolation will help organise the game’s code structure.
<br><b>Pygame or Tkinter:</b> Depending on the graphical package you choose, you should know how to use Pygame or Tkinter to make graphical displays and handle events.
<br><b>Handling user input: </b> To direct how the snake moves, you need to know how to record and handle user input, especially computer events.
<br><b>Basic game creation ideas: </b> To make the Snake game, you need to understand game loops, changing game states, creating pictures, and handling collisions.
<br><b>2D arrays and lists:</b> If you know how to work with 2D arrays or lists, you will be able to show the game screen and control where the snake is.

Even though you don’t have to have experience in these areas, having a strong base will make it easier to understand the ideas and apply the game rules well. Installing an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or IDLE is also a good idea so you can write and run Python code.
